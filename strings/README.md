## Introduction
The list of problems which can come under a broad heading of problem solving are 
inserted here. 

# List of Problems
- Longest Uniform String
  
  Given a string, return the position and length of the substring which has largest 
  number of repeatable characters in the string.
  
  Example: "11100" -> [0, 3]
     
     "abcd"  -> [0, 1]
  
  Since, the largest substring with same characters is "111" which starts at position 0 and length of the substring is 3.
  In case of a tie between substrings, return the left most substring as shown in the second example.

- Break Word Problem
  
  This is a problem where given a dictionary of words, and an input string, you have to figure out if the string can be split into words present in the dictionary only.
  If yes, then print the words separated by space or new line. It should also print all the possible sentences the input string can be split into.
  
- Length of Longest Substring
  In this problem, we are performing two tasks
  
  1.the length of longest substring which does not have any repeated characters.
  
  2.the length of longest substring which has all characters in alphabetical order
  
  The answer is printed as per user's choice.

- Permute String
  
  This problem finds and prints all the permutations of a given string taken as input from user.
  
- String Subsequence
  
  Given two strings, check if the first string can be formed by removing some (or none) of the characters of the second string
  
- Remove Character
  
  Remove all ocurrences of a given character from a string. Code contains both recursive and iterative approach
