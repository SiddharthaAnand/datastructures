# datastructures - algorithms - problem solving

This repository consists of problems in data structures and algorithms related to 
problem solving. 
Most of the problems worked out here are from www.geeksforgeeks.org, hackerrank.com,
hackerearth.com, cracking the coding interview book and some random questions scattered
all over the internet.

# languages used - C, C++, Java and Python.

Feel free to change and improve the existing code. Add documentation where necessary.
Follow coding guidelines in the respective languages as much as possible.

Also, if possible, add all the possible test cases in the commented section at the top
of the code to make it easier to understand.

# Happy coding!
